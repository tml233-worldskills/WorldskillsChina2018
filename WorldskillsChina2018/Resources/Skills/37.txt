The key role for a landscape gardener is to design, install and maintain gardens and landscaped areas. The landscape gardener will need to meet with clients to discuss their proposed projects, provide advice and guidance on the practicalities of the project and carefully interpret the client¡¯s wishes. Projects can be varied and incorporate private and public gardens, parks, public open spaces, sports and recreation venues, playgrounds and other landscaped areas. The landscape gardener must be able to develop innovative schemes that meet the needs of clients and comply with planning regulations, while retaining a vision of how the finished project will fit into the overall area and how garden spaces interact with urban environments.

The landscape gardener may be involved at all stages of a project from the initial consultation and design, throughout the installation process, project managing and supervising the installation team, to providing advice and guidance on on-going maintenance and development as the garden grows and matures.
