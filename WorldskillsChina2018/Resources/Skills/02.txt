Cable is the medium through which information usually moves from one network device to another.  There are several types of cable which are commonly used in network infrastructures.  In some cases, a network will utilise only one type of cable, while other networks will use a variety of cable types.  The type of cable chosen for a network is related to the network¡¯s topology, protocol and size. Understanding the characteristics of different types of cable and how they relate to other aspects of a network is necessary for the development of a successful network.

The Network Cabling Technician constructs the infrastructure of all the telecommunication networks such as those for Wide Area Networks (WAN), Local Area Networks (LAN) and Cable TV (CATV).  This work is highly technical and requires detailed specialised knowledge in order to independently design and install networks that meet clients¡¯ needs and conforms to recognised industry standards. The technician will create the foundation which is the basis for the network, install cables appropriate for the intended use, maintain and test and commission the network.
