CNC Turning is a branch of engineering. Engineers have to find mechanical solutions that can make complex designs possible. Within an assembly that you may see and use every day, every single part interacts with every other. This is true of cars, Smartphones, aircraft, and so on; the possibilities are endless. For example, there are about 10,000 parts in just one car. Engineers create assemblies of many parts, and using many different materials, through CAD (Computer Assisted Drawing) software.

Each part of an assembly is made of different materials, and needs different geometries, dimensions and surface qualities. The engineer brings all these requirements into technical drawings which are called ¡°blueprints¡±. But who will build these parts? To answer that question we have to decide the best way to produce each part. There are many ways of doing this, like welding, milling, casting, and 3D Printing. One very important method is CNC Turning
