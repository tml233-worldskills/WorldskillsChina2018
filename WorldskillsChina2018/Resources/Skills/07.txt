Most people cannot imagine how important these technologies are in their lives. There is nothing that we use that hasn¡¯t in its manufacturing utilized CNC technology. It is present in products and objects of everyday life as e.g. cars, airplanes, components of machines of all types, moulds for tools used for household machines, medical prosthetics, cell phones and toys etc.

CNC milling machines are machine tools which are used for the shaping of metal and other solid materials. These machines exist in two basic forms: horizontal and vertical. This refers to the orientation of the cutting tool spindle. Early milling machines were manually or mechanically automated, but technological advances have led to the development of Computer Numerical Control, such as CNC machining centre. CNC refers to a computer (¡°control¡±) that reads and stores instructions. This numerical information generally ¡°G and M¡± codes (a programing language) is then used to control and drives a machine tool, a powered mechanical device (¡°machining centre¡±). A machining centre is used to fabricate components using cutting tools for removal of material.
