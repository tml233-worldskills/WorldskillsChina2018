A plumbing and heating technician works on commercial, residential, agricultural and industrial projects. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the product required and the payment made by the customer. Therefore the practitioner has a continuing responsibility to work professionally in order to meet the requirements of the customer and thus maintain and grow the business. Plumbing and heating is closely associated with other parts of the construction industry, and with the many products that support it, normally for commercial purposes.

The plumbing and heating technician works internally, including the homes of customers and on small and major projects. He or she will plan and design, select and install, commission, test, report, maintain, fault find and repair systems to a high standard. Work organization and self-management, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, flexibility and a deep body of knowledge are the universal attributes of the outstanding practitioner.
