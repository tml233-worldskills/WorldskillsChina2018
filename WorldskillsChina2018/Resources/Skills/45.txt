The prototype modelling practitioner is involved with the design, creation, testing and modification of prototypes. In many fields, there is great uncertainty as to whether a new design will actually do what is desired. New designs often have unexpected problems. A prototype is often used as part of the product design process to give engineers and designers the ability to explore design alternatives, test theories and confirm performance prior to starting production of a new product. Prototype modelling practitioner use their experience to tailor the prototype according to the specific unknowns still present in the intended design. For example, some prototypes are used to confirm and verify consumer interest in a proposed design, whereas other prototypes will attempt to verify the performance or suitability of a specific design approach.

In general, an iterative series of prototypes will be designed, constructed and tested as the final design emerges and is prepared for production. In most cases, multiple iterations of prototypes are used progressively to refine the design. It is common to design, test, evaluate and then modify the design based on analysis of the prototype.
