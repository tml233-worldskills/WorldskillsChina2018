A painter and decorator works in the commercial and public sectors and is responsible for the external and internal appearance of a building and its protection from water, rust, mould and insects. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service required and the payment made by the client. Therefore the painter and decorator has a continuing responsibility to work professionally and interactively with the client in order to give satisfaction and thus maintain and grow the business. Painting and decorating is closely associated with other parts of the construction industry, and with the many products that support it.

The painter and decorator works internally and externally in very diverse environments, for example in companies, factories, schools, hotels, the homes of clients and on building sites in all weather conditions. He or she may offer a range of services, including interpreting client requirements/drawings, advising on designs/colours, painting, spraying, decorative coatings, wallpapering, gilding and sign writing to a high standard.
