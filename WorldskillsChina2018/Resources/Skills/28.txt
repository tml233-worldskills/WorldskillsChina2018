The florist may work in one of several sectors but often they are self-employed and work on commissioned projects or in the retail sector. As such they need to have business acumen and excellent interpersonal skills when dealing with clients. Excellent levels of customer care and sales skills are crucial. As themed floral works are often commissioned for important life events such as weddings, the florist must have perception and be able to offer appropriate expert advice to the client whilst interpreting the vision for the finished project.

Flowers and other botanical materials are delicate, easily damaged or spoilt and have a limited storage life. As such the florist must be respectful of the raw materials with which they work and apply extensive knowledge of effective sourcing, purchasing and storage of all botanical materials.
