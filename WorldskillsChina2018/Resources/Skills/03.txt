The skill competition of Manufacturing Team Challenge is based on the design, manufacture assembly and testing of equipment by teams of complementary specialists. In either large or small manufacturing operations there is a strong demand for several specialists to come together to design, manufacture, assemble and test new or improved equipment either as a one-off item or as the prototype for mass production.

Technicians skilled in project management, computer-aided design, programming, machining, welding, electrical/electronics and fitting can combine to form efficient and effective teams covering design through to commissioning. While each specialism has value in its own right, each team member requires additional attributes. The capacity to work within and contribute to a team is vital, requiring both self-understanding and interpersonal skills. Team members also need the ability to think beyond their own specialisms and the boundaries of each skill, in order to make the most of the team¡¯s combined efforts.
