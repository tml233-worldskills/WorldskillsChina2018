A visual merchandiser creates window and interior displays in shops and department stores thus is essentially responsible for the ¡®look¡¯ of the retail outlet. The chief aim of a visual merchandiser is to maximize sales by communicating with the target audience and creating a positive atmosphere. The visual merchandiser communicates directly with the target audience through their designs and creates a positive impression which in turn impacts on the sales revenue of the business. Whilst not possible to precisely measure the impact of the visual merchandiser¡¯s displays it is accepted that they are an increasingly important element of the marketing and sales mix of a successful retail business.

The visual merchandiser works in retail outlets, which are part of a group with central support functions and in small independent shops where there is greater personal autonomy and responsibility. The activities a visual merchandiser undertakes are based on interpreting and researching a brief, creating a design, and implementation - working with the products and their props.
