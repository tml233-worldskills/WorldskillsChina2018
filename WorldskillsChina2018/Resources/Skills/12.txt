A tiler generally works on commercial and residential projects. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the product required and the payment made by the customer. Therefore the tiler has a continuing responsibility to work professionally in order to meet the requirements of the customer and thus maintain and grow the business. Tiling is closely associated with other parts of the construction industry, and with the many products that support it, normally for commercial purposes.

The tiler works internally and externally, including in the homes of customers and on building sites, in all weather conditions and on small and major projects. The work includes the laying of tiles of ceramics, mosaic and natural stone on walls, floors and staircases in houses, commercial, industrial and public buildings, churches, swimming pools, outside installations and fa?ades to provide protective and decorative finishes. It also includes the construction of small walls and steps from bricks or blocks.
