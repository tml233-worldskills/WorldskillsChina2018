A beauty therapist generally works in the commercial sector, offering specialist services, treatments and advice for the skin, body care, massage and make-up of individual clients. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service required, and the payment made by the client. Therefore the beauty therapist has a continuing responsibility to work professionally and interactively with the client in order to give satisfaction and thus maintain and grow the business. Beauty therapy is closely associated with other parts of the service sector, such as hairdressing, fashion, and media and with the many products and services that support it, normally for commercial purposes.

Beauty therapy also has an important therapeutic role in supporting individual¡¯s self-esteem and confidence. It also helps to ameliorate the effects of illness, and can aid recovery.
