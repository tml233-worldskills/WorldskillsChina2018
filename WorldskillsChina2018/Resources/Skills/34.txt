The professional chef can work in a wide range of establishments including high class restaurants and hotels, welfare catering such as hospitals and residential homes and industrial sites providing catering services to staff. The range of skills and customer expectations will vary according to the work-place. There is also a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service provided and the payment made by the customer or corporate client. As well as the skill of cooking, the role of a chef will also demand further skills that relate to cooking in a commercial setting and therefore working to a budget or expected profit margin. These skills include menu compilation and costing, control and correct storage of stock, planning work for self and others and managing a kitchen brigade.

The chef in a high class hotel or restaurant offering fine dining will need to demonstrate outstanding skills in food preparation and presentation. They will be expected to create and adapt dishes that meet the expectations of demanding customers who are used to dining in exclusive restaurants. Fashions and trends in cuisine fluctuate so it is important that the top class chef keeps abreast of these trends and adapts their product and service accordingly. The customer wishing to experience fine dining is expecting a memorable meal experience which incorporates the setting and ambiance of the restaurant, restaurant theatre and outstanding customer care as well as exceptional food.
