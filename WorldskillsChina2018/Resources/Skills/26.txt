A carpenter generally works on commercial and residential projects. Carpentry is closely associated with other parts of the construction industry, and with the many products that support it, normally for commercial purposes.

The carpenter works internally and externally, including in the homes of customers and on building sites in all weather conditions. He or she will interpret drawings, set out and measure, cut, form joints, assemble, install and finish to a high standard.
