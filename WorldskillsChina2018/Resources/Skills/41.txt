A health and social care practitioner offers a range of support to individual clients and their family and has a continuing responsibility to work professionally and interactively with the client in order to ensure their holistic care needs are met. Whilst the health and social care practitioner may work directly for the client they are normally employed by an organization within the health and social care sector. Health and social care is closely associated with the medical profession.

The health and social care practitioner works in diverse environments, including the homes of clients, hospitals, community day care and residential and nursing homes. He or she manages health, physical and psychosocial well-being, support of growth and development, caring and rehabilitation. The support provided is based on assessing planning, delivering and evaluating a care programme.
