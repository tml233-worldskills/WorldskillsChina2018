Computer aided design is the use of computer systems to assist in the creation, modification, analysis or optimization of an engineering design. CAD software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communication through documentation and create a database for manufacturing. CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for print, manufacturing or other manufacturing processes.

The technical and engineering drawings and images must convey information such as materials, processes, dimensions and tolerances according to application-specific conventions. CAD may be used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional (2D) space or curves, surfaces and solids in three-dimensional (3D) space. CAD is also used to produce computer animation for the special effects used in, for example, advertising and technical manuals.
