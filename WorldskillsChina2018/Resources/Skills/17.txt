Web Design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The diversity of the skills required by a web developer are many, often to the point it is difficult for a web designer to excel in all aspects. As a result, a team may cover the Web Design process, with each member of the team having their own strengths, specialties and role in the development process.

Web Design involves implementing specific solutions that follow the business rules and objectives outlined by the client. Web Designers develop a professional relationship with their clients, interacting with them in order to develop a deep understanding of the requirements and convert these into a website specification. Strong design and communication skills, coupled with research techniques and a grasp of target audiences, markets and trends, will ensure initial client satisfaction and credibility for the Web Designer.
