A Concrete Construction Worker generally works on commercial and residential projects. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the product required and the payment made by the customer. Therefore the Concrete Construction Worker has a continuing responsibility to work professionally in order to meet the requirements of the customer and thus maintain and grow the business.

Concrete Construction Work is closely associated with other parts of the construction industry, and with the many products that support it, normally for commercial purposes.
