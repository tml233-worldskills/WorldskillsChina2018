The DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) has a goal of developing innovative robotics technology for use by robots responding to natural and man-made disasters. The DRC kicked off in 2012 to run 27 months including three planned competition events - one virtual and two live. Track the Challenge by visiting the website. DRC is an outgrowth of the initial DARPA Grand Challenge program which inspired and challenged teams to design, build and operate fully autonomous (self-driving) off-road vehicles. The first team to pass a series of qualification tests and then complete the course in less than the prescribed ten-hour time limit received a $1 million cash prize (increased subsequently to $2 million). Challenges have evolved and continue to spark and engage teams from around the world.
