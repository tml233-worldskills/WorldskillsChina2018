A sheet metal technician interprets drawings, develops suitable patterns, cuts and forms sheet materials into complex shapes and assemblies both manually and by machine. He or she works in a range of materials including ferrous and non-ferrous materials and therefore needs to understand the joining and fastening of all of these materials.

Sheet metal technicians work in factories and workshops specifically equipped with a range of hand tools, power tools and specialist machines capable of forming and assembling sheet metal into simple and complex shapes.
