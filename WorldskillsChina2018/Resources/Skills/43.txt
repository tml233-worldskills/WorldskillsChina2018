Plastic Die Engineers are engaged in the mass production of plastic products of high quality but low cost. This is achieved by producing a mould based on drawings by a competent designer who understands Design for Manufacturing and assembly principles, having hands on injection moulding, mould making, plastic part design and mould design software experiences.

The designing and processing of a mould is done with the help of CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Machining) systems. Most of the machining is done on CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining centres. The machined parts are then polished according to requirements and assembled to keep them ready for trial. Completed moulds will be installed in an injection moulding machine, and then plastic products are manufactured.
