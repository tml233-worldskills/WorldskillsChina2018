The modern Light Vehicle Automobile Technician is likely to be employed in a workshop that is closely associated with one major manufacturer of light vehicles. Their expertise may be greatest with that manufacturer¡¯s vehicles; however, depending on the situation and range of services offered by the workshop, they may also handle other manufacturers¡¯ vehicles. Automobile Technicians also work in garages and workshops that are not associated with particular manufacturers. Where this is the case they may experience a wider range of light vehicles and use alternative equipment, parts and materials.

The trained and competent Light Vehicle Automobile Technician will service and repair a range of light vehicles. For diagnosis, repair and replacement, depending on the nature of the workshop, they may use the manufacturers¡¯ equipment, parts, materials and procedures. Therefore, according to a workshop¡¯s relationship with manufacturers, the Technician¡¯s experience may be deep or broad, or both. In every garage and workshop success is measured in time, correct fault finding and repair, and repeat business.
