Construction metalworking involves the skills required to mark out, cut and assemble, repair and maintain steel structures such as buildings, bridges, heavy plant and lifting equipment. A construction metalworker must have a good knowledge of mathematical calculations and geometrical techniques, and be able to interpret simple and complex engineering drawings. He or she must be able to fabricate small to large structures and check them for correct dimensions, square, parallel and flatness.

A construction sheet metalworker must be capable of applying the above skills to a range of steels including low carbon, stainless, alloy steels and aluminium alloys. He or she must also have a comprehensive knowledge of a range of industrial cutting and forming processes to suit these materials.
