Cabinetmaking covers the manufacture of free-standing and built-in furniture and units, using wood at the sole or main material. It may include the design of furniture, but normally comprises the creation of furniture and units from designs prepared by others. Cabinetmaking differs from joinery through the quality of the wood and associated materials used, and the intricacy and aesthetic quality of the finished items. There is, however, some overlap between cabinetmaking and joinery.

A cabinetmaker generally works on commercial and residential assignments of a high quality and value. He or she will therefore exhibit very high standards of skill and professionalism in order to justify clients¡¯ expectations and willingness to pay. Most cabinetmakers work in small companies which have to be very sensitive to their reputation and market in order to sustain their businesses¡¯ viability.
