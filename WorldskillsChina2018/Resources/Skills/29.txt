A hairdresser generally works in the commercial sector, offering a range of services and treatments to the hair for individual clients. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service required, and the payment made by the client. Therefore the hairdresser has a continuing responsibility to work professionally and interactively with the client in order to give satisfaction and thus maintain and grow the business. Hairdressing is closely associated with other parts of the service sector, and with the many products that support it, normally for commercial purposes.

Hairdressing also has an important therapeutic role in supporting individuals¡¯ self- esteem and confidence. It also helps to relieve the effects of illness, and can aid recovery.
