THE FIRST NATIONAL COMPETITION

It was 1946 and there was a great need for skilled workers in Spain. Mr Jos Antonio Elola Olaso, who was General 
Director of OJE (Spanish Youth Organization), had an insight: it was necessary to convince youth, as well as their parents, teachers and prospective employers, that their future depended on an effective vocational training system.

Mr Olaso chose Francisco Albert-Vidal to further develop this idea together with Antonio Almagro Diaz and Faustino Ramos Diaz, who were on different occasions directors of the Work Centres. Dr Di  medes Palencia Albert, Director at that time of "Virgen de la Paloma" (the most important Spanish Training Centre), was appointed as technical adviser for the whole project. For this challenge the most suitable solution was apparently to promote a competition. So, young people's competing spirit would be aroused, adults would discuss the competition results and visitors would be able to see a great variety of trades being demonstrated.

Right from the start, State agencies, enterprises and religious vocational training schools were interested in the idea.

This simple yet brilliant idea of watching people from different trades at their workstations proved to be a great success. So, in 1947, with the participation of around 4,000 apprentices from a dozen mechanical trades, the first National Competition took place in Spain.
