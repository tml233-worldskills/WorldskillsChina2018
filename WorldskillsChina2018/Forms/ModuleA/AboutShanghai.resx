    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>History about Shanghai

The trace of Shanghai in China’s history may have only several hundred years. However, to trace back the history of Shanghai, you will be surprised to find that its history is not that short as it seems. According to textual research, Shanghai area has become the Yangtze River deltaic plain in the Songze Era 5000 years ago. Shanghai’s ancestors have left their footsteps there. 
Shanghai was part of Wu state in the Spring and Autumn Period, and Yue Sate at first and then Chu state in the Warring States Period. The king of Chu appointed Huangxie as prime minister and named him “Chun Shen” which Shanghai was part of his manor estate and where it gained its another name “Shen”.
“Hu”, another name of Shanghai, came from “Hu Du”. In ancient time, the fishermen in Shanghai area invented a kind of fish-catching tool called “Hu”, and this area was named “Hu Du” because the name “Shanghai” has not been formed.
The name “Shanghai” was officially started from the dynasty of Song. At that time, Shanghai has evolved into a newly-developed commerce port. There were 18 large Pu at that time in Shanghai area, one of which is Shanghai Pu. Nowadays, there is a Shanghai Town on the west bank of the Huangpu River between the Bund and 16 Pu. That is where Shanghai got its name from.
Shanghai Town has seen great development in the dynasty of Yuan and Bureau for Foreign Shipping was also established at that time. After that, Shanghai Town was promoted to Shanghai County. Shanghai became the largest center of textile industry in Ming Dynasty with more and more advanced commercial activities. In the 24th year of Kangxi emperor of Qing Dynasty (1685 A.D.), Customhouse was set up there.  During Qianlong and Jiaqing era, Shanghai gradually became the commercial port and grain transportation center well-known as “Great water way to river and sea and Capital of the Southeast”.
In 1843, after the Second Opium War, Shanghai was forced to become a treaty port by the colonialists. In 1845, Britain established the first foreign concession in Shanghai and then was followed by the USA. In 1849, France followed suit. In 1863, after the British and American foreign concessions were combined into one public settlement area, Shanghai was actually divided into 3 parts: Chinese residential area, public concession and French concession. During the next 100 or more years after 1843, Shanghai became the main port for foreign colonialists to dump goods, plunder raw materials and wealth. That’s why Shanghai was named “The adventurers ’fairyland”.
On July 7, 1927, Shanghai Special Administrative City was declared to be founded. On July 1, 1930, Shanghai City was officially established. The foreign concessions in Shanghai was taken back after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1945. On May 27, 1949, Shanghai was liberated from the hand of KMT. With time going by, Shanghai became an important base for industry and commerce of People’s Republic of China due to the hard-working from both every government of Shanghai and people. 
After 20 year’ reform and opening-up (1978-1998), especially after the South Inspection Speech was given in 1993 by Deng Xiaoping, the chief designer of the reform and opening-up, Shanghai has been changing quickly and is becoming the center of China’s economy, finance, science and technology, information and culture, which manifests that an international modern metropolis is gradually being formed. </value>
